I. Introduction
---------------
This is a reimplementation of the Berkeley Parser
(http://code.google.com/p/berkeleyparser/). Some of the class files
are copied from the Berkeley parser with possible changes to class
names and contents. The original purpose of the reimplementation was
to develop ideas that cannot be easily implemented on top of the
original Berkeley Parser. The parser has subsequently evolved with
several enhancements to improve parsing performance. Here are some
highlights of the parser:

   1. Training is parallelized to support multi-threading; 
   2. Parsing is parallelized, supports n-best extraction, constrained
      and unconstrained Viterbi decoding, parsing score reporting, and
      parsing with multiple grammars through a product model;
   3. Includes a featured lexical model to: 1) alleviate over-fitting
      via regularization, 2) handle OOV words using a featured OOV
      model P(POS_tag|word), and 3) exploit lexical features for
      grammar induction using a featured latent lexical model
      P(latent_tag|word,POS_tag).

This parser was used in the following papers:

   1. Self-Training PCFG Grammars with Latent Annotations Across
      Languages, Zhongqiang Huang and Mary Harper, EMNLP 2009
   2. Self-training with Products of Latent Variable Grammars,
      Zhongqiang Huang, Mary Harper, and Slav Petrov, EMNLP 2010
   3. Feature-Rich Log-Linear Lexical Model for Latent Variable PCFG
      Grammars, Zhongqiang Huang and Mary Harper, IJCNLP 2011

II. Training Grammars
---------------------
I will first give several examples of how I usually train grammars and
then briefly describe some selected options of the grammar trainer.

   a) train a Chinese grammar (without the feature rich lexical model):
      java -Xmx7000m -ss10m -cp umd-featured-parser.jar edu.umd.clip.parser.GrammarTrainer -train ctb6.train.list -out ctb6 -jobs 8 -seed 0 -lang chinese

   b) train a English grammar (without the feature rich lexical model) on WSJ and some automatically parsed training data:
      java -Xmx7000m -ss10m -cp umd-featured-parser.jar edu.umd.clip.parser.GrammarTrainer -train wsj.selftrain.list -out wsj_selftrained -jobs 8 -numSplits 7 -lang english -seed 8 -manualTrees 39832 -autoWeight 0.2

   c) train a Arabic grammar on ATB using built-in feature extractors for the featured lexical model (see the IJCNLP2011 paper): 
      java -Xmx7000m -ss10m -cp umd-featured-parser.jar edu.umd.clip.parser.GrammarTrainer -train atb.train.list -out atb -jobs 8 -seed 0 -lang arabic -featured -splitIter 200

   d) train a grammar for a new language using external feature files for the featured lexical model (see the IJCNLP2011 paper):
      java -Xmx7000m -ss10m -cp umd-featured-parser.jar edu.umd.clip.parser.GrammarTrainer -train some_lang.train.list -out some_lang -jobs 8 -seed 0 -lang others -featured -splitIter 200 -wordPred word.feature.file -oovPred oov.feature.file


Here is the description of some selected options:

   -train train_list: train_list is a file containing a list of
      filenames, each of which points to a parse tree file with one
      parse tree per line. The trainer only supports LDC
      treebank-style constituency parse trees. 

   -in init_grammar: specify if resuming training from an existing
      grammar file init_grammar.

   -out grammar_prefix: trained grammars will be saved as
      grammar_prefix-i.gr, where i=0,...,num_splits.

   -numSplits num_splits: the trainer will run num_splits rounds of
      splitting-merging iterations. More splittings result in better
      parsing accuracies (also larger and slower grammars) when more
      training data is available. The optimal num_splits should be
      determined externally using a development set. "-numSplits 6" is
      usually good for training grammars on WSJ, CTB6, and
      ATB. "-numSplits 7" may give better results if more training
      data is available (e.g., in self-training) or multiple grammars
      are later combined into a product model in parsing.

   -splitIter num_split_iter: this is the number of EM iterations
      after each splitting step. I usually use "-splitIter 200" when
      the featured lexical model is enabled and use the default
      "-splitIter 50" otherwise.

   -mergeIter num_merge_iter: this is the number of EM iterations
      after each merging step. I just use the default "-mergeIter 20".

   -smoothIter num_smooth_iter: this is the number of EM iterations to
      smooth lexical and rule probabilities. I just use the default
      "-smoothIter 10".

   -jobs num_jobs: this is the number of concurrent jobs for EM
      training. I usually set it to the number of cores on a machine.

   -seed rand_seed: this is the seed of the random number
      generator. Due to high variance in EM training, I usually train
      multiple grammars with different seeds (e.g., 0~9), and use the
      development set to pick the best grammar. Grammars trained with
      different seeds can also be combined into a product model in
      parsing to achieve better parsing accuracies.

   -autoWeight weight: this is the weight for each automatically
      labeled parse tree. When training with automatically labeled
      training data in self-training, I usually set weight to
      (number_of_manual_trees / number_of_automatic_trees) so that the
      manually labeled trees and the automatically labeled trees
      contribute roughly equally to the training likelihood. In order
      to make this work, the training trees in train_list need to be
      ordered so that the manual trees are listed before the automatic
      parse trees, and the -manualTrees option needs to be set to the
      number of manual trees.

   -manualTrees: the number of manual trees; use with -autoWeight.

   -featured: set this flag to use the featured lexical model.

   -lang language: the parser has built-in heuristics to support
      English, Chinese, and Arabic when the featured lexical model is
      not used. The featured lexical model has built-in feature
      extractors for English, Chinese, Arabic, and other languages
      (they are all the same by now but could be modified to be
      language-dependent). If you want to modify the built-in feature
      extractors, take a look at function initPredStats in
      edu.umd.clip.parser.FeaturedLexiconManager for the latent
      lexical model and function initPredStats in
      edu.umd.clip.parser.FeaturedOOVLexiconManager for the OOV model.

   -wordPred word_feature_file: instead of using the built-in feature
      extractor for the latent lexical model (see IJCNLP2011 paper),
      one can use features in an external feature file to train the
      featured latent lexical model. This file should contain features
      for each word type in the training and test sets, with one line
      containing one word type followed by a list of features, e.g.,
  
      expletive wid:expletive prefix1:e prefix2:ex prefix3:exp suffix1:e suffix2:ve suffix3:ive
      CFC-11 wid:CFC-11 prefix1:C prefix2:CF prefix3:CFC suffix1:1 suffix2:11 suffix3:-11 init_cap has_hypen has_digit all_cap
  
      Note that the featured lexical model assumes that each word type
      has a unique feature vector and doesn't support multiple feature
      vectors for different instances of the same word type. If your
      data has multiple feature vectors for the same word type, you
      can try two solutions:

      a) modify your training and test data to use a unique feature
         vector (e.g., the most frequent one) for each word type;

      b) split the word type into multiple different word types so
         that each one has exactly one unique feature vector; this
         should be done on both training and test data and you can map
         the split word types back to the original word type after
         parsing.

   -oovPred oov_feature_file: similar to the "-wordPred" option, if
      this option is used, the featured lexical model will use the
      features in the external feature file oov_feature_file to train
      the featured OOV model. The requirement of oov_feature_file is
      the same as the word_feature_file and these two files can be the
      same.

To see the complete list of options and their default values, type:
   java -cp umd-featured-parser.jar  edu.umd.clip.parser.GrammarTrainer -h


III. Parsing with a Single Grammar
---------------------------------
Again, I will first give several examples of how to run the parser
with a trained grammar and then briefly describe some options of the
parser.

   a) parse with a single grammar:
      java -Xmx7000m -ss10m -cp umd-featured-parser.jar edu.umd.clip.parser.SingleParser -gr wsj-6.gr -input wsj.test.sents -output wsj.test.parsed -jobs 8

   b) parse with a single grammar, produce 50-best parse trees, with joint parse probability of the sentence (log-scale) and the parsing scores for each hypothesis:
      java -Xmx7000m -ss10m -cp umd-featured-parser.jar edu.umd.clip.parser.SingleParser -gr wsj-6.gr -input wsj.test.sents -output wsj.test.parsed -jobs 8 -nbest 50 -ll -score

   c) parse with a single grammar, produce the viterbi parse derivation (with latent tags) on the best parse tree:
      java -Xmx7000m -ss10m -cp umd-featured-parser.jar edu.umd.clip.parser.SingleParser -gr wsj-6.gr -input wsj.test.sents -output wsj.test.parsed -jobs 8 -constrainedViterbi


Here is the description of some selected options:

   -gr grammar_file: the trained grammar file.

   -input input_file: the input file to parse; use STDIN as input if
      this option is not set.

   -output output_file: the output parsed file; use STDOUT as output
      if this option is not set.

   -jobs num_jobs: this is the number of concurrent parsing jobs. I
      usually set it to the number of cores on a machine.

   -nbest nbest_size: output the nbest parse trees if nbest_size > 0.

   -ll: output the log-likelihood of sentences under the grammar.

   -score: output the model score of parse trees as determined by
      the parser.

   -tokenize: the parser assumes tokenized input by default. If this
      flag is enabled, the parser will use the Stanford PTBLex
      Tokenizer to tokenize the input on the fly. This only works for
      English.

   -viterbi: by default the parser uses MaxRuleProduct (see Petrov and
      Klein, 2007) as the objective for finding the best parse tree;
      when "-viterbi" is enabled, the parser returns the most probable
      derivation with latent annotations on tags

   -nolatent: this removes latent annotations from the viterbi
      derivation; works with -viterbi

   -constrainedViterbi: when enabled, the parser will first find the
      MaxRuleProduct parse tree and then return the viterbi derivation
      within this parse tree. This would produce a more accurate
      derivation than what can be produced with the "-viterbi" flag
      enabled.

To see the complete list of options and their default values, type:
   java -cp umd-featured-parser.jar  edu.umd.clip.parser.SingleParser -h


IV. Parsing with Multiple Grammars
----------------------------------
The parser also supports parsing with multiple grammars through a
product model, as follows:
   
   java -Xmx15000m -ss10m -cp umd-featured-parser.jar edu.umd.clip.parser.ProductParser -gl wsj-6.gl -input wsj.test.sents -output wsj.test.parsed -jobs 8

Here is the description of some selected options:

   -gl grammar_list: this is a list file with one grammar file name per
       line.

   -input input_file: the input file to parse; use STDIN as input if
      this option is not set.

   -output output_file: the output parsed file; use STDOUT as output
      if this option is not set.

   -jobs num_jobs: this is the number of concurrent parsing jobs. I
      usually set it to the number of cores on a machine.
   
   -tokenize: the parser assumes tokenized input by default. If this
      flag is enabled, the parser will use the Stanford PTBLex
      Tokenizer to tokenize the input on the fly. This only works
      properly for English.

To see the complete list of options and their default values, type:
   java -cp umd-featured-parser.jar  edu.umd.clip.parser.ProductParser -h


V. Parsing Accuracies 
--------------------- 
Using the same data splits in our IJCNLP2011 paper, the parser with a
featured lexical model produces the following results (F score) on the
respective test sets:

    +----------+----------------+---------------+
    | Language | Single Grammar | Product Model |
    +----------+----------------+---------------+    
    | English  |       90.4     |      91.7     |
    | Chinese  |       85.1     |      86.8     |
    | Arabic   |       81.7     |      83.6     |
    +----------+----------------+---------------+

VI. Miscellaneous Issues
------------------------
1. Memory usage hasn't been optimized yet. "-Xmx7000m" is usually
   enough for training and parsing with a single grammar but expect to
   allocate more memory when training a self-trained grammar or
   parsing with multiple grammars.

2. The parser has gone through many changes and may not produce
   exactly the same results as reported in the original papers.

3. The parser expects tokenized input and requires an external
   tokenizer for languages other than English (an English tokenizer is
   included).

4. As mentioned earlier, the featured lexical model assumes that each
   word type has a unique feature vector and doesn't support multiple
   feature vectors for different instances of the same word
   type. Please see possible solutions above.

5. The parser may not work well if your language has a rich tag
   set. In the current implementation of the featured lexical model,
   each feature of a word type is conjoined with a latent POS tag to
   make an internal feature of the model (see predLatentTagWeightsMap
   in edu.umd.clip.parser.FeaturedLexiconManager for the featured
   latent lexical model and predTagWeightMap in
   edu.umd.clip.parser.FeaturedOOVLexiconManager for the featured OOV
   model). As a result, features of different latent POS tags are
   independent. Ideally, there should be some sharing mechanism among
   features of similar tags. It is possible to modify the
   implementation of the featured lexical model to achieve. The key is
   to implement something similar to predLatentTagWeightsMap (and
   predTagWeightMap) that allows features to be shared among similar
   tags.

6. This code is provided as it is. I appreciate any bug reports and I
   will try to fix them if time allows. I may not be able to add new
   functionalities.
